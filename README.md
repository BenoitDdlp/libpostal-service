# Pelias Libpostal Service

This is a `Dockerfile` for creating an instance of the [whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-libpostal](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-libpostal#wof-libpostal-server) server for use by Pelias. There's no actual code here.

To use the libpostal-service outside of Docker, see the [install instructions](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-libpostal#install) for the whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-libpostal project.
